Michelangelo, the free-spirited and pizza-loving Turtle, decides to throw the ultimate pizza party for his brothers and friends. The sewer lair transforms into a festive wonderland with pizza-themed decorations, cheesy games, and a dance floor hotter than a jalape√±o slice.

The Turtles, April, and Casey Jones join in the celebration, letting loose and enjoying a well-deserved break from their crime-fighting duties. Mikey's pizza party extravaganza is a shell of a good time, filled with laughter, camaraderie, and, of course, an endless supply of pizza.

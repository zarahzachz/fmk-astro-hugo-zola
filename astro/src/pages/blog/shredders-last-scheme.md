Cowabunga! The Shredder is back, and this time, he's hatching a sinister plan to take over the entire city. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles find themselves thrust into a shell-shocking battle against the forces of evil. As the streets of New York City become a battleground, our heroes must rise to the occasion once again.

In a dark and shadowy lair, The Shredder meticulously orchestrates his latest scheme. The Foot Clan, armed to the teeth, executes a multi-pronged assault on key locations across the city. The Turtles, ever-vigilant, leap into action, determined to thwart The Shredder's malevolent plot.

```python
def battle_sequence(heroes, villains):
    for hero in heroes:
        for villain in villains:
            if hero.can_defeat(villain):
                hero.attack(villain)
            else:
                villain.attack(hero)
    return determine_winner(heroes, villains)

def determine_winner(heroes, villains):
    # Logic to determine the winner based on remaining strength
    # and successful attacks.
    pass

# Call the battle sequence with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Foot Clan.
turtles = get_turtles()
foot_clan = get_foot_clan()
winner = battle_sequence(turtles, foot_clan)
```

The night is filled with acrobatic flips, masterful martial arts, and the clang of metal against metal as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael face off against the formidable Foot Clan. The clash between good and evil reaches its climax atop the city's rooftops, where the fate of New York hangs in the balance.

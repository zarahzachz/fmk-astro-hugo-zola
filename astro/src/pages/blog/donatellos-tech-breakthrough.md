Donatello, the genius of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, unveils his latest technological breakthrough to give the team an edge in their ongoing battle against evil. From high-tech bo staffs to crime-fighting gadgets, the Turtles find themselves equipped with cutting-edge inventions that push the boundaries of innovation.

```javascript
class CrimeFightingGadget {
  constructor(name, features) {
    this.name = name;
    this.features = features;
  }

  activate() {
    // Code to activate the gadget and perform its functions.
  }
}

class HighTechBoStaff extends CrimeFightingGadget {
  constructor() {
    super("High-Tech Bo Staff", ["Extendable", "Electrified", "Sensors"]);
  }

  spinAttack() {
    // Code for a powerful spinning attack using the high-tech bo staff.
  }
}

// Create instances of Donatello's inventions.
const boStaff = new HighTechBoStaff();
boStaff.activate();
boStaff.spinAttack();
```

Donatello's lab becomes a hub of creativity and experimentation as he fine-tunes his creations. The Turtles test the new tech in a series of daring missions, facing off against robotic foes and high-tech adversaries. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and Donatello grapples with the ethical implications of his inventions.

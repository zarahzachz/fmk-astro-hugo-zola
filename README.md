# FMK: Astro, Hugo, and Zola

A personal experiment where I create and compare a simple blog built with Astro, Hugo, and Zola.

The following parameters will be explored as part of this experiement:

- To get a feel for the Markdown parsing, each build will make use of the same content (mostly from `/original-content`)
- To get a feel for project organization and maintenence, each build will have at least two templates
  - Homepage view has list of all content, filterable
  - Single page view is the individual url for each piece of content
- To see how extendable the Markdown content can be, each build will have at least one a reusable component in a Markdown file
  - Just for simplicity, this will be an alert component
- To see if adding CSS is hard and to experiment with each build's CSS capabilities, basic styling will be added to control layout (for mobile and desktop)
- To test how easy it is to use JS (e.g., minification, treeshaking, etc.), each build will have a "filter content" feature to sort content by tag and/or content type
- **Stretch goal:** To get a feel for built-in functionality, each build will implement 5 posts and notes per page pagination

I'll grade how each SSG performs based on the "How much did doing this piss me off?" scale (ü§©, üòé, üòê, üò†, or ü§¨).

## Astro

To run the project locally, `cd astro` and run `npm run dev` (assuming everything's been installed).

| Markdown               | üò†    | I'm too familiar with how other SSG handle parsing content (e.g., using a content variable) to feel good about writing this much JS to do the same thing (do I use Fragment? Content? Slot? Collections? It's too much and too murky.). |
